Find gcd of two numbers a and b


Assuming a>b

a = bq+r where q and r are quotient and remainer

since a and b have a gcd(a,b)

x * gcd(a,b) = y * gcd(a,b) * q + r

This implies r is a multiple of gcd(a,b) so 

x * gcd(a,b) =  t * gcd(a,b) + z * gcd(a,b)  

Hence

b = t * gcd(a,b)
r = z * gcd(a,b)   where t and z are two integers

gcd(b,r) = gcd(t,z) * gcd(a,b)


Let's assume gcd(t,z) = h where h!=1
This implies,   a,b also has a divisor h* gcd(a,b) which is a contradiction since there can be no divisor greater than the gcd(a,b) itself
so gcd(t,z) is always 1

gcd(b,r) =  gcd(a,b) This is the established recurrance relation
